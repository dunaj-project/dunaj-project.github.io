<p>This chapter describes language skeleton for designing and
working with network resources in a distributed system. For this
purpose, Dunaj defines abstractions for messages, resources and
services. The goal is to define simple, composable and
interoperable abstractions which fit into existing language
concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A distributed system is a collection of interacting computer
processes located on networked computers. These processes
communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.</p>

<p>A Message is an information that is sent between communication
endpoints. Examples of message types: byte, string,
number, collection or ad-hoc data type. Structure of
message is defined by a communications protocol.</p>

<h3 id="_message_stream">Message stream</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of time, messages exchanged between communication endpoints
form a message stream. Depending on the purpose of communication,
this stream may be finite, have a predefined length or even be
infinite.</p>

Stream is represented by a collection recipe. Stream
      cannot be 'closed' per se, it can only be finished. Because
      each stream is represented by a reducible collection, there
      is no need to represent the 'end of stream' value.

<h3 id="_communications_protocol">Communications protocol</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A communications protocol is the set of rules governing message
exchange between communication endpoints.
Examples of communication protocols: HTTP, WebDAV,
TCP, UDP, RS232, Modbus, memcached, WebRTC, websocket, bittorrent.
Protocols are often built upon other protocols
(e.g. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP, which can be implemented on
top of TCP, which uses IP, etc.).</p>

<h3 id="_communication_channel">Communication channel</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A communication channel mediates a communication between
endpoints for the purpose of message exchange.
Messages exchanged between endpoints are defined and sent/received
according to the specified communications protocol, supported and
agreed upon by all involved parties.
A communication channel can be in form of a connection (e.g. TCP),
or may be connectionless (UDP). It can mediate a communication
between two entities (e.g. unicast), or between many entities
(e.g. multicast, broadcast). Communication channel can be one
direction only (simplex), or it may mediate two way communication
(half/full duplex).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A resource is an object of limited availability,
optionally identified by a URI,
that models a computer or network resource.
Resource example: file, web page, message queue service,
database management system, weather web service, network socket.</p>
</div>

<p>Resource related concepts described in this section are defined in a

<h3 id="_computer_resource">Computer Resource</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A computer resource, or system resource, is resource of limited
availability within a computer system. Computer resource and
services it provides can be used by computer processes running
in the respective computer system.
Examples of computer resources: file, network socket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because these resources are of limited availability, computer
process needs to acquire computer resource before it can use it.
More importantly, computer process have to release acquired
resources as soon as they are no longer needed.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_network_resouce">Network resouce</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A network resource is a resource accessible within a computer
network. Network resources provide services that perform one
or more functions as a result of a message received over a network
from a consumer.
Examples of network resources: weather web service, web
server, database management system, web page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer process can access network resources exclusively via
a communication channel. This involves often nontrivial process
of setting up and maintaining a communication channel, in which
computer resources are utilized and specific steps defined by a
respective communication protocol have to be taken. If such process
can be standardized, it can be implemented into a object called
client, which takes care of network resource setup and management.
Look further down for descriptions of client
and other relevant abstractions.</p>

<h3 id="_resource_acquisition">Resource Acquisition</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resources are acquired via a respective resource factories.
(The term 'factory' relates to the process of creating data objects
representing acquired resources, not to the resource creation as
such. When acquiring, no new resources are created. If new
resource of a given type can be created, it is done in an
API or service unrelated to the resource factory or even to the
functionalities of a given resource.)</p>

Resource factory is represented by a record object tha
      implements <code>IAcquirableFactory</code> protocol. The resource factory
      contains all configuration in its map-like part. That way the
      resource can be configured as a normal map. The factory
      protocol defines <code>-acquire!</code> method, which returns
      object representing an acquired resource.
      An <code>acquire!</code> fuction is called with the resource factory as
      its argument, and it acquires a resource within a given scope
      as specified in the resource factory configuration.
      Acquired resource may additionally implement <code>IConfigured</code>
      protocol, which defines <code>-config</code> method. This method returns
      the factory configuration used to acquire the respective
      resource.

In Dunaj, every object representing such resource has to
      implement <code>IReleasable</code> protocol. Same applies for objects that
      'own' a resource outside their method calls. <code>IReleasable</code>
      protocol defines <code>-release!</code> method. This method
      should be called when resources this object 'owns' or
      represents are no longer needed. To prevent resource leaks,
      objects implementing <code>IReleasable</code> should be wrapped in a
      <code>with-scope</code> macro. Newly acquired objects are pushed to the
      current scope, often as a weak refs, if host supports such
      construct. Scope releases resources in LIFO mode.
      If supported by host, resources must also be
      released upon such object&#8217;s finalization (e.g. finalize
      method in Java). Any further operations on a released
      resource must throw an exception.
      For more detailed control over the release process, Dunaj
      defines <code>grab-scope</code> and <code>release-scope!</code> functions.

<p>Network resource which provides a specific service is called a

such service is called a service consumer. The middleman between
consumer and provider is called a service requester, and it is used
to establish and maintain a communication channel between external
service provider and a service consumer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Service provider is often called a server and a service requester
is called a client. In some cases service requester functions also
as a service provider for other consumers. Such resource is called
a service peer. This concept is used e.g. in P2P services such
as bittorrent.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_client">Client</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client, also known as a service requester, helps to establish a
communication channel between a service consumer and a service
provider. It may handle also such tasks as a reconnection,
service partitioning (load balancing, sharding), handshaking,
session initialization and other necessary things which may have
to be realized before service provider&#8217;s functionalities can
be utilized by a service consumer.
Client may keep an opened connection, have a connection pool and
is free to establish new channels if needed or close the ones which
are no more used. Therefore, it is generally preferred to use a
client instead of lower level communication channel, if a suitable
client is provided.</p>

Client may expose to the service consumer a protocol
           which is different from those of service providers.
           This is especially true in P2P services, where e.g.
           handshaking or session initialization may be handled
           transparently without consumer&#8217;s intervention.
